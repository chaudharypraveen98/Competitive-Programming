In this challenge, you must read an *integer*, a *double*, and a *String* from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the *Output Format* section below. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.


**Note:** We recommend completing [Java Stdin and Stdout I](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stdin-and-stdout-1) before attempting this challenge.

**Input Format**

There are three lines of input: 


1. The first line contains an *integer*.
2. The second line contains a *double*.
3. The third line contains a *String*.
**Output Format**

There are three lines of output:


1. On the first line, print `String:` followed by the unaltered *String* read from stdin.
2. On the second line, print `Double:` followed by the unaltered *double* read from stdin.
3. On the third line, print `Int:` followed by the unaltered *integer* read from stdin.


To make the problem easier, a portion of the code is already provided in the editor. 


**Note:** If you use the *nextLine()* method immediately following the *nextInt()* method, recall that *nextInt()* reads integer tokens; because of this, the last newline character for that line of integer input is still queued in the input buffer and the next *nextLine()* will be reading the remainder of the integer line (which is empty).

**Sample Input**


```

**Sample Output**
