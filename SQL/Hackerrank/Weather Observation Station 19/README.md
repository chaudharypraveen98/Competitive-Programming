Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.
