Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in **STATION**).
- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in **STATION**).
- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in **STATION**).
- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in **STATION**).

Query the [Manhattan Distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) between points P1 and P1 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:
