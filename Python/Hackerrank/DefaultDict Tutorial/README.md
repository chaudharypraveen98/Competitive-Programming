## **[DefaultDict Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/defaultdict-tutorial)** 
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
For example:<br>This prints:<br><br><br><br>**Sample Input 0**<br><br>**Sample Output 0**<br><br>**Explanation 0**<br><br>
